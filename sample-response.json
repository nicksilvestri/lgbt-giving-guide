With the progression of technology, you can talk to them through their website, call them over the phone, or text them. They are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. They offer support for those who may not feel comfortable starting a conversation, they offer a space for those ages 13-24 to connect with each other and provide a resource ranging through broad topics.",
