<h1>Designs</h1>
<p>I like to design things that look &quot;good&quot; (whatever that means).</p>

<h2>Saltwater Tavern</h2>
<h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/swt-website.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/swt-website-mobile.jpg"></p>
<p>I designed and developed this website for a new restaurant. I figured most people go to a restaurants website if they've never been to the actual establishment before. I put the scrolling photo gallery front and center so people could get a feel for the restaurant. I also put the hours, address and contact information right on the front page because I wanted the "distance" between the user and the information they're seeking to be as little as possible.<br><br><a href="http://www.saltwatertavern.com/">Click here to go to the website!</a> <br>Please note that I am not currently responsible for its maintenance.</p>

<h2>URI Center for Career and Experiential Education</h2>
<h3>Branding and Identity Design</h3>
<p>If I had to describe the branding of the CCEE in 3 words, they would be Clean, Consistent, and Emojis. My goal when creating the identity of this department was to make something that URI students would respond to.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/ccee-events.jpg"></p>
<p>This is the events flyer, which was printed poster sized and on 8.5&quot;x11&quot;. Almost every other printed graphic from the department has the same border.</p>

<hr>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/ccee-flyers.jpg"></p>
<p>This was the template I used for any special events we had on campus. These were printed poster sized and 5.5&quot;x8.5&quot; (half-sheet).<p>

<h3>Infographic Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/ccee-rhode-to-success.jpg"></p>
<p>This infographic was designed for students at all stages of their college career. There is a poster of it hanging in the lobby and we also printed 8.5&quot;x11&quot; handouts.<p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/ccee-internship-rhode-map.jpg"></p>
<p>This infographic was designed for students to see if they were eligible for our program to do an internship for credit. Printed on 8.5&quot;x11&quot;.<p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/ccee-volunteer.jpg"></p>
<p>This flow chart was created for students at URI who are looking to volunteer. I created it to streamline the walk-in process at the volunteer office. Printed on 5.5&quot;x8.5&quot; (half-sheet).<p>
<hr>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/ccee-choose-a-major.jpg"></p>
<p>This handout was for students with undeclared majors, who need guidance choosing a major. Printed on 8.5&quot;x11&quot;.<p>

<h2>Happily Mad</h2>
<h3>Movie Poster Design & Photo Manipulation</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/happily-mad.jpg"></p>
<p>This poster was designed for an independent film called <i>Happily Mad</i>. I designed the logo and edited the photo, which included color correction, and other little edits like the shine on the knives and deleting unwanted light reflections. <p>
</main>

<h2>Be.</h2>
<h3>Logo and T-shirt Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/be-logo.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/be-shirt.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/be-photos.jpg"></p>
<p>When I created this design, I didn't want it to be just another race/volunteer shirt that gets stuffed to the bottom of the drawer. My goal was to create something that not only has a good message, but looks good too! (Photos are property of the University of Rhode Island)<p>

<h2>The Struggle of Infinity</h2>
<h3>Book Cover Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/struggle-of-infinity.jpg"></p>
<p>I designed this book sleeve for a friend of mine. Most of his poems are abstract and dark, so I wanted the cover to reflect that. Printed and bound by yours truly.<p>
</main>

<main>
<h2>SK CARES</h2>
<h3>Logo Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/sk-cares-logo.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/sk-cares-photo.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/sk-cares-process.jpg"></p>
<p>This logo was designed for SK CARES, a local nonprofit based in South Kingston, RI. That's me with the co-presidents of the organization. If you look hard enough, you can see it on their shirts! I also included early designs to show the process.<p>

<h2>URI S.A.V.E.S. Polar Plunge</h2>
<h3>Flyer Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/polar-plunge.jpg"></p>
<p>This flyer was designed for an event hosted by URI S.A.V.E.S. benefitting The Tomorrow Fund. It was mostly used on social media, but was also printed on 8&quot;x8&quot;. I wanted it to be recognizable when it is as small as a profile picture, but still have details about the event.<p>
</main>

<main>
<h2>Rhody Outpost</h2>
<h3>Logo Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/rhody-outpost.png"></p>
<p>This logo was designed for Rhody Outpost, an emergency food pantry for the students of University of Rhode Island. The Ram in the icon is the Official URI logo.</main>

<main>
<h2>Snapchat</h2>
<h3>Geofilter Design</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="/assets/misquamicut.jpg"></p>
<p>I designed the geofilter for Misquamicut, RI, which is used by Snapchatting tourists and residents.<p>
